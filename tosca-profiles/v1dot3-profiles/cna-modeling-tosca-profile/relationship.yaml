      relation_type:
        type: string
        required: true
        description: Type of relation, e.g. subscribes to or calls
      timeout:
        type: integer

  cna.qualityModel.entities.HostedOn.DeploymentMapping:
    derived_from: tosca.relationships.HostedOn
    description: Relationship Type to model DeploymentMapping entities
    properties:
      deployment:
        type: string
        required: true
        description: How this deployment mapping is described or ensured. Valid values can be manual, automated imperative, or automated declarative
        default: manual
      deployment_unit:
        type: string
        required: true
        description: When this deployment mapping can be described as a specific unit of deployment (e.g. a Kubernetes Pod), state it here. Otherwise it is custom.

        type: integer
        description: The minimum number of replicated instances for the deployed component when it is running
        required: true
        default: 1
      update_strategy:
        type: string
        required: true
        description: How the deployed entity is updated in case a new version is deployed. It can simply be replaced by an instance of the new version, or specific strategies like "rolling upgrade" or "blue-green" can be used.
        default: in-place 
      automated_restart_policy:
        type: string
        required: true

      usage_relation:
        type: string
        required: true
        description: Describes how a component uses attached data, that means whether it just uses (reads) it for its functionality or if it also updates and persists (writes) it; possible values are usage, cached usage, and persistence
      sharding_level:
        type: integer
        required: true
