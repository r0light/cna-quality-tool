node_types:

  cna-modeling.entities.Component:
    derived_from: SoftwareComponent
    description: Node Type to model Component entities
    properties:
      managed:
        type: boolean
        description: A component is managed if it is exclusively operated by someone else, e.g. a cloud provider and the source code of the component instance is inaccessible. If the source code of a component can be changed by yourself, the component is not managed.
        required: true
      software_type:
        type: string
        description: The type of the software in the sense of who developed it. If it is a self-written component use "custom", if it is an existing open-source solution which is not customized (apart from configuration) use "open-source". If it is licensed proprietary software, use "proprietary".
        default: custom
        required: true

      stateless:
        type: boolean
        description: True if this component is stateless, that means it requires no disk storage space where data is persisted between executions. That means it can store data to disk, but should not rely on this data to be available for following executions.
