      timeout:
        type: integer
        description: If a timeout is applied for this link, specify it's length here. If no timeout is applied, use 0.
        default: 0
        required: true
      retries:
        type: integer
        description: Number of times this invocation is retried, if it fails.

        default: none
    valid_capability_types: [ Endpoint, Endpoint.Public ]

  cna-modeling.entities.HostedOn.DeploymentMapping:
    derived_from: HostedOn
    description: Relationship Type to model DeploymentMapping entities
    properties:
      deployment:
        type: string
        required: true
        description: How this deployment mapping is described or ensured. Valid values can be manual, automated imperative, or automated declarative
        validation: { $valid_values: [ $value, [ "manual", "automated-imperative", "automated-declarative", "transparent"]]}
        default: manual
      deployment_unit:
        type: string
        required: true
        description: When this deployment mapping can be described as a specific unit of deployment (e.g. a Kubernetes Pod), state it here. Otherwise it is custom.
        default: custom
      replicas:
        type: integer

        default: 1
      update_strategy:
        type: string
        required: true
        description: How the deployed entity is updated in case a new version is deployed. It can simply be replaced by an instance of the new version, or specific strategies like "rolling upgrade" or "blue-green" can be used.

      resource_requirements:
        type: string

      usage_relation:
        type: string
        required: true
        description: Describes how a component uses attached data, that means whether it just uses (reads) it for its functionality or if it also updates and persists (writes) it; possible values are usage, cached usage, and persistence
