            <h1>Clounaq - Cloud-native architectural quality</h1>
            <p>This web-based application represents the tooling support for the Clounaq approach. 
               The overall goal is to enable quality evaluations for software architectures of cloud-native application based on a quality model.
               With this application you can:</p>

               <ul class="feature-list">
                <li>View the Quality model</li>
                <li>Create models of software architectures</li>
                <li>Evaluate applications based on their modeled architecture and the quality model</li>
               </ul>
               <p> 
               The tool is <span class="font-weight-bold">still in development</span>, but you can already give it a try. Please use a desktop pc or similar with a suitable screen size. The application, especially the modeling functionality, is not optimized for mobile devices.
